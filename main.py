# Is it possible to combine all my practice exercises into one repo on Github? This would be proof that I have completed all the exercises.
# Maybe there is a way to make a menu to choose which exercise I want to show.
# The menu is probably best written as a function. Maybe I create all the different activities as functions and then I make a function that asks for which function.
# Yes, that means a function of functions.
